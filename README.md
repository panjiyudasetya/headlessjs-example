# headlessjs-example
This is an experiment project to implement Headless JS on React Native Application for Android. 
It's painful actually because there is no actual document implementation of [React Native - Headless JS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/next/docs/headless-js-android.html#headless-js).

So here is my objective :
- I want to run a background service on JS Side but it also possible to interact with Native function.

Then I got this result.
